In this project, I created Charts and Dashboards in Microsoft Excel using sales data from a sample company. 
You will used PivotTables to look at discrete trends in the data, which I then represented as line, bar, and pie charts. 
Towards the end of the project, I summarized the sales data creating a dashboard composed of the charts and tables to provide a global picture of the sales data.
